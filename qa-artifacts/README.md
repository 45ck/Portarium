# QA Artifacts

Local/manual QA captures are stored here and are intentionally gitignored by default.

Use this folder for:

- ad-hoc screenshots
- exploratory browser captures
- temporary media generated during QA runs

Use `qa-artifacts/manual-evidence/` for manually captured evidence and keep long-lived documentation assets in `docs/` only when they are intentionally curated.
