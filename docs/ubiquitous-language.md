# Ubiquitous Language (VAOP terms)

- **VAOP (Vertical Autonomous Operations Provider):** The overall platform concept—AI + workflows + governance to run non-core business ops using existing tools plus "machines."
- **Control Plane:** The VAOP layer that governs execution (workflows, policy tiers, approvals, audit/evidence, tenancy/RBAC, credentials, adapter/machine registry).
- **Data Plane:** The integrated systems and services where data lives and work happens (SoRs, SaaS APIs, machines), invoked by workflows.
- **Workspace / Tenant:** The isolation boundary for an organization/client (users, roles, policies, credentials, runs, evidence, configs).
- **System of Record (SoR):** The authoritative system for a domain (ERP/CRM/helpdesk/accounting). VAOP coordinates; the SoR owns "truth."
- **Port:** A stable VAOP-defined interface for a business capability (e.g., CRM, Accounting, Support, Comms, Payments).
- **Adapter / Connector / Provider:** A concrete implementation of a Port for a specific SoR/vendor (e.g., HubSpot CRM adapter, Odoo Accounting adapter).
- **Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL):** The translation boundary inside an adapter that prevents vendor quirks from leaking into VAOP's canonical model.
- **Capability Matrix:** Required metadata each adapter exposes (supported objects, read/write, auth modes/scopes, limits/rate, sandbox, events/webhooks).
- **Canonical Domain Model:** The minimum shared set of cross-system objects VAOP standardizes (v1: Customer, Lead, Ticket, Invoice, Payment, Employee, Task, Campaign, Asset, Document).
- **Workflow / Runbook:** An imperative, durable sequence of steps that calls ports/adapters/machines with retries and gates.
- **Action:** A single externally-effectful operation inside a workflow (create invoice, send email, publish campaign, update ticket, etc.).
- **Execution Tier:** Enforcement level applied per action (Auto, Assisted, Human-approve) based on policy (risk/scope/cost).
- **Policy:** Rules that determine what can run, under what tier, with what constraints (limits, scopes, required approvals).
- **Approval Gate:** A workflow pause that requires a human decision (approve/deny/request-changes) before continuing.
- **Diff ("What will change"):** A versioned preview of intended effects produced before execution for approval/review.
- **Run:** A single execution instance of a workflow (status, timings, retries, outcomes).
- **Evidence Log (Append-only):** The immutable audit trail of runs (inputs, outputs, approvals, actions, actors, timestamps, links to external objects).
- **Evidence Artifact:** A stored immutable file/object associated with a run (reports, generated assets, specs, receipts, transcripts).
- **Machine:** A value-producing generator that outputs artifacts (content-machine, demo-machine, poster-machine, etc.); not a data sync connector.
- **Wrapper:** A standard interface layer that makes any machine callable in a uniform way (inputs/outputs/auth/artifact handling).
- **Artifact:** Any produced output (image/video/spec JSON/PDF/repo) generated by machines or assembled by workflows.
- **Project (Container):** A lightweight grouping construct for runs/artifacts/policies/owners (not a full PM tool).
- **Credential Vaulting:** Secure storage and scoped issuance/rotation of connector secrets per tenant and provider.
- **RBAC:** Role-based access control over actions, approvals, credentials, and visibility within a tenant.
- **Idempotency:** The property that repeating an action produces the same result (or safely no-ops), enabling retries without duplicates.
- **Record/Replay (Fixtures):** Captured API interactions used to deterministically test adapters without live calls/rate limits.
- **Contract Tests:** Tests that verify adapter behavior and schemas against each Port's required contract.
- **Commands API / Queries API / Event Stream:** The three public surfaces—write operations, read views, and append-only events for realtime UIs/sinks.
- **Strategy Selection (`selectProvider(tenant, port)`):** The runtime resolution that chooses which adapter/provider a tenant uses for a given port.
