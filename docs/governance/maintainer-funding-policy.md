**Bead:** bead-0748
**Status:** Active
**Date:** 2026-02-23

## Funding Channels

Portarium accepts funding through two platforms:

| Platform        | Purpose                                           | Link                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| GitHub Sponsors | Individual and corporate sponsorships             | `.github/FUNDING.yml`        |
| Open Collective | Transparent collective funding with public ledger | `open_collective: portarium` |

## Allocation Policy

Funds received are allocated according to these priorities:

1. **Infrastructure costs** — CI/CD compute, container registry, staging environments, domain registration
2. **Security audits** — Third-party penetration testing and dependency audits
3. **Contributor stipends** — Bounties for high-priority issues and sustained contributors
4. **Event participation** — Conference talks, meetups, and community events

## Transparency

- Open Collective provides a public ledger of all income and expenses.
- GitHub Sponsors income is reported in quarterly maintainer updates.
- All allocation decisions above $500 require approval from two core maintainers.

## Eligibility for Contributor Stipends

Contributors may receive stipends when:

- They have merged at least 3 non-trivial PRs (feature or bug fix, not typo corrections).
- The work addresses a P0 or P1 bead.
- A core maintainer nominates the contribution for a stipend.
- The stipend amount is approved by at least one other core maintainer.

## Corporate Sponsorship Tiers
