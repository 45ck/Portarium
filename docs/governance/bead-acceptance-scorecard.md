## Rules

- Required for all beads: `specAlignment`, `tests`, `review`, `docs`.
- `security` is required for security/governance beads or beads with security keywords.
- `performance` is required for beads with explicit performance/load/SLO keywords.
- Banding:
  - `green`: all always-required criteria pass and score >= 80%.
  - `amber`: score >= 60% but not green.
  - `red`: score < 60%.
