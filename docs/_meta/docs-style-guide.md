# Docs Style Guide

## Goals

- Keep docs close to source-of-truth files.
- Prefer links to canonical contracts over duplicated tables.
- Keep examples runnable and current.

## Writing rules

- Use glossary terms from `docs/glossary.md`.
- State current behavior, then planned direction if needed.
- Call out scaffold or stub status when relevant.
- Keep headings task-oriented.

## Structure

- Tutorials: guided learning path
- How-to: task recipes
- Reference: factual contracts and interfaces
- Explanation: architecture and rationale

## Diagrams and assets

- Prefer Mermaid for architecture and flow diagrams.
- Store generated assets in `docs/assets/`.
- Add prompt and provenance details for generated visuals.

## Review checklist

- links resolve
- examples are valid commands
- terminology matches glossary
- references point to current source files
