# Explanation: Design System

Cockpit design artifacts currently live under `docs/ui/`.

## Current source documents

- `docs/ui/project-ui-v1.md`
- `docs/ui/cockpit/README.md`
- `docs/ui/cockpit/`

## Direction

- Keep design tokens explicit and reusable.
- Document accessibility and keyboard interaction requirements.
- Keep screenshots and walkthrough evidence versioned with docs.

## Asset usage

Generated visual assets should be tracked under `docs/assets/` with prompt provenance.
