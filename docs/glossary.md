# Portarium Glossary (Ubiquitous Language)

This is the canonical vocabulary for the Portarium project (VAOP architecture). Use these terms consistently in code, docs, conversations, and tests. One concept = one name = one meaning.

---

## A

### Account (Financial)

A financial or general-ledger account. One of the 14 canonical objects. Represents the universal concept of a named account with a type (asset, liability, equity, revenue, expense) and currency, observed across all accounting and billing SoRs.

### Action

A single externally-effectful operation inside a workflow (e.g., create invoice, send email, publish campaign, update ticket).

- **Synonyms to avoid**: step, task (use "Action" for externally-effectful operations)

### Adapter / Connector / Provider

A concrete implementation of a Port for a specific SoR/vendor (e.g., HubSpot CRM adapter, Odoo Accounting adapter).

- **Invariant**: Each adapter must declare a Capability Matrix.

### Adoption Tier (A1–A4)

Market-penetration ranking for SoR providers: A1 (dominant, >30% share), A2 (strong contender, 10–30%), A3 (established niche, 1–10%), A4 (emerging/regional).

### Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)

The translation boundary inside an adapter that prevents vendor quirks from leaking into VAOP's canonical model.

### Approval Gate

A workflow pause that requires a human decision (approve/deny/request-changes) before continuing.

- **Invariant**: Approvals sign off on a Plan object, not raw data.

### Artifact

Any produced output (image/video/spec JSON/PDF/repo) generated by machines or assembled by workflows.

### Asset (Canonical)

An IT asset, fixed asset, or inventory item. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across ITSM, IAM, and compliance SoRs.

## C

### Campaign (Canonical)

A marketing or advertising campaign. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across marketing automation, ads platforms, and CRM SoRs.

### Canonical Domain Model

The minimum shared set of cross-system objects VAOP standardises.

- **v2 objects**: Party, Ticket, Invoice, Payment, Task, Campaign, Asset, Document, Subscription, Opportunity, Product, Order, Account, ExternalObjectRef
- **v1 objects (superseded)**: Customer, Lead, Ticket, Invoice, Payment, Employee, Task, Campaign, Asset, Document
- **Synonyms to avoid**: "shared model", "common model"

### Capability Matrix

Required metadata each adapter exposes: supported objects, read/write, auth modes/scopes, limits/rate, sandbox, events/webhooks, idempotency mechanism, plan/diff support, reversibility/compensation.

- **Invariant**: Must be a formal schema artifact, versioned, validated in CI.

### Control Plane

The VAOP layer that governs execution: workflows, policy tiers, approvals, audit/evidence, tenancy/RBAC, credentials, adapter/machine registry.

### Credential Vaulting

Secure storage and scoped issuance/rotation of connector secrets per tenant and provider.

## D

### Domain Atlas

A structured research artifact and re-runnable extraction pipeline producing: CIF (Canonical Integration Format) snapshots anchored to upstream commits, explicit mappings from vendor entities to VAOP canonical objects, and executable contract tests. See ADR-035.

### Data Plane

The integrated systems and services where data lives and work happens (SoRs, SaaS APIs, machines), invoked by workflows.

### Diff ("What will change")

A versioned preview of intended effects produced before execution for approval/review.

- **Types**: Planned effects, Verified effects, Predicted effects (optional).

### Document (Canonical)

A document, file, or attachment. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across document management, e-signature, comms, compliance, marketing, and support SoRs.

## E

### ExternalObjectRef / ExternalObjectReference

A first-class deep link to any SoR entity that does not map to a canonical object. Carries: `sorName`, `portFamily`, `externalId`, `externalType`, `displayLabel`, `deepLinkUrl`. Every canonical object has an `externalRefs` array of these.

### Evidence Artifact

A stored immutable file/object associated with a run (reports, generated assets, specs, receipts, transcripts).

### Evidence Log (Append-only)

The immutable audit trail of runs: inputs, outputs, approvals, actions, actors, timestamps, links to external objects.

- **Invariant**: Metadata is immutable; payloads are retention-managed.

### Execution Tier

Enforcement level applied per action based on policy:

- **Auto**: policy-allowed, low risk
- **Assisted**: AI drafts + safe steps auto-run; human approval where required
- **Human-approve**: explicit approval for high-liability actions
- **Manual-only**: explicitly left outside automation; Portarium may create/track a linked task and wait on a completion signal, but does not execute the action

## I

### Integration Catalog

The living reference documenting every SoR provider across all 18 port families, with source rankings (S1–S4), adoption tiers (A1–A4), entity catalogs, and canonical mappings. Located at `docs/integration-catalog/`.

### Invoice (Canonical)

A sales invoice or purchase bill. One of the 14 canonical objects. Includes credit notes and debit notes as subtypes. Observed across accounting, billing, and procurement SoRs.

### Idempotency

The property that repeating an action produces the same result (or safely no-ops), enabling retries without duplicates.

- **Invariant**: Must be measurable per action via capability matrix fields + tests.

## M

### Machine Registration

A registered autonomous agent (machine) within a Workspace. Machines produce artifacts (content, reports, etc.) and are distinct from adapters (which connect to SoRs).

### Machine

A value-producing generator that outputs artifacts (content-machine, demo-machine, poster-machine, etc.); NOT a data sync connector.

- **Synonyms to avoid**: "service", "worker" (use "Machine" for artifact producers)

## O

### Opportunity (Canonical)

A sales opportunity or deal. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across CRM SoRs (Salesforce Opportunity, HubSpot Deal, Pipedrive Deal, etc.).

### Order (Canonical)

A sales order or purchase order. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across CRM, procurement, and accounting SoRs. Discriminated by `orderType` (sales/purchase).

## P

### Portarium

The product name for the VAOP control plane. Used in public-facing materials, the repository name, and package identity. VAOP remains the internal architecture acronym. See ADR-036.

### Party (Canonical)

A unified person or organisation with role tags. One of the 14 canonical objects. Replaces the v1 Customer, Lead, Vendor, and Employee types. Roles include: `customer`, `lead`, `vendor`, `employee`, `contractor`, `partner`, `user`, `contact`, `org`. Observed across all 18 port families.

### Payment (Canonical)

A payment record (charge, refund, transfer, payout). One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across finance, billing, payroll, and procurement SoRs.

### Plan

A structured object describing intended effects that approvals sign off on. Includes: planned writes, constraints, external refs, required scopes, predicted effects confidence. Diffs are explicitly typed: **Planned Effects** (what Portarium intends), **Verified Effects** (observed delta after execution), and optionally **Predicted Effects** (best-effort preview where SoR supports dry-run). See ADR-027.

### Policy

Rules that determine what can run, under what tier, with what constraints (limits, scopes, required approvals).

- **Includes**: Segregation of duties (SoD), multi-actor constraints.

### Port

A stable VAOP-defined interface for a business capability (e.g., CRM, Accounting, Support, Comms, Payments).

### Port Family

A grouping of related ports/adapters by business capability. VAOP defines 18 port families: FinanceAccounting, PaymentsBilling, ProcurementSpend, HrisHcm, Payroll, CrmSales, CustomerSupport, ItsmItOps, IamDirectory, SecretsVaulting, MarketingAutomation, AdsPlatforms, CommsCollaboration, ProjectsWorkMgmt, DocumentsEsign, AnalyticsBi, MonitoringIncident, ComplianceGrc.

### Product (Canonical)

A product, service, or SKU. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across billing, CRM, and procurement SoRs.

### Project (Container)

A lightweight grouping construct for runs/artifacts/policies/owners. NOT a full PM tool.

## R

### RBAC

Role-based access control over actions, approvals, credentials, and visibility within a tenant.

### Record/Replay (Fixtures)

Captured API interactions used to deterministically test adapters without live calls/rate limits.

- **Invariant**: Fixtures must be redacted/scrubbed for secrets and sensitive data.

### Run

A single execution instance of a workflow (status, timings, retries, outcomes).

## S

### SoD Constraint (Separation of Duties)

A policy rule that prevents the same person from performing conflicting roles (e.g., initiating and approving the same Run). Critical for SOX/SOC 2 compliance.

### Source Ranking (S1–S4)

API-quality ranking for SoR providers: S1 (OpenAPI spec + sandbox + webhooks), S2 (API with gaps), S3 (community SDK/unofficial), S4 (scraping/file-based).

### Strategy Selection

The runtime resolution that chooses which adapter/provider a tenant uses for a given port: `selectProvider(tenant, port) -> adapter`.

### Subscription (Canonical)

A subscription, contract, or agreement. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across billing, procurement, and ITSM SoRs. Covers recurring billing subscriptions, procurement contracts, service agreements, and software licenses.

### System of Record (SoR)

The authoritative system for a domain (ERP/CRM/helpdesk/accounting). VAOP coordinates; the SoR owns "truth."

## T

### Task (Canonical)

A work item, project task, or to-do. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across project management, CRM, and comms/collaboration SoRs. Calendar events are modelled as tasks with `type:event`.

### Ticket (Canonical)

A support ticket, service request, or incident. One of the 14 canonical objects. Observed across customer support, ITSM, monitoring/incident, and compliance SoRs. Subtypes include: incident, change request, problem, service request, and compliance finding.

## V

### VAOP (Vertical Autonomous Operations Provider)

The internal architecture acronym describing the platform pattern: AI + workflows + governance to run non-core business ops using existing tools plus machines. The product name is **Portarium** (see ADR-036); VAOP is used in technical documentation and domain model references.

## W

### Work Item

A lightweight cross-system binding object (case) that connects SoR links (ExternalObjectRefs to Jira tickets, Zendesk cases, CRM records, PRs, CI runs), VAOP Runs, Approvals, Evidence entries, SLA metadata, and Owner assignment. Projects remain a lightweight container for grouping Work Items. See ADR-038.

- **Synonyms to avoid**: "case" (too domain-specific), "issue" (conflicts with Jira), "ticket" (conflicts with canonical Ticket)

### Workflow / Runbook

An imperative, durable sequence of steps that calls ports/adapters/machines with retries and gates.

### Workspace / Tenant

The isolation boundary for an organisation/client: users, roles, policies, credentials, runs, evidence, configs.

### Wrapper

A standard interface layer that makes any machine callable in a uniform way (inputs/outputs/auth/artifact handling).

## Contract Tests

Tests that verify adapter behaviour and schemas against each Port's required contract.

## Commands API / Queries API / Event Stream

The three public surfaces:

- **Commands** (write path): start workflow, request approval, apply decision, rotate credentials
- **Queries** (read path): runs, policies, connectors, artifacts, approvals
- **Event stream**: append-only run/evidence events for realtime UI + external sinks
