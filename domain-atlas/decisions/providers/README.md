# Provider Notes

This folder holds per-provider research notes to complement the structured artefacts under:

- `domain-atlas/sources/`
- `domain-atlas/extracted/`
- `domain-atlas/mappings/`
- `domain-atlas/capabilities/`

Keep notes focused on:

- Model invariants and lifecycle quirks worth capturing in CIF.
- Action safety/idempotency/diff semantics worth capturing in capability matrices.
- Mapping decisions (canonical vs `ExternalObjectRef`) worth making explicit.
