Scope: (1) Add skip-navigation link at top of app layout — visually hidden until focused, jumps to main content area. (2) Audit every icon-only button (IconButton, action icons in tables/cards); add descriptive aria-label to each. (3) Audit all status badge components; add text label or aria-label conveying the status in addition to colour; add pattern/icon for colour-blind users. (4) Audit all modal/dialog components; add focus trap (focus-trap-react or Radix Dialog handles this automatically — check if Radix is available); add Escape key close; confirm focus returns to trigger element on close. (5) Run axe-core after each fix; baseline score must improve.

Several critical components are still stubbed or in-memory only (bootstrap uses empty stub stores by default, rate-limiting is in-memory, some APIs always return null). Custom regex-based HTTP routing lives in one large handler module.

Overlaps with reports 23, 27, and 29 — coordinate to avoid duplicate beads.\n\n**Key themes**:\n\n### Architecture and Design\n- In-memory stubs as defaults: non-functional system ships silently without real store config — needs fail-fast guards or real defaults\n- Regex routing monolith: single large handler module — migrate to Hono/Fastify or extract route definitions\n- Incomplete port abstractions: interfaces exist but contract tests are missing\n\n### Scalability Risks\n- In-memory rate-limiter not safe for horizontal scaling or pod restarts\n- No explicit Postgres connection pool configuration\n- Temporal worker concurrency fixed (not configurable)\n- No backpressure on NATS consumer\n\n### Code Quality Violations\n- Some HTTP responses return raw Error objects (stack traces exposed)\n- Magic strings for event types (should be enums/const)\n- Optional chaining gaps — potential runtime null refs\n- List-parsing error paths return raw error strings\n\n### CI/CD Gaps\n- No coverage reporting artifact in CI\n- No lint result artifact uploaded\n- Argo rollout exists but no canary smoke test before promoting\n\n**Exit criteria**: In-memory default stubs have fail-fast guards; routing extracted/migrated; coverage reporting added; all P0/P1 items fixed or deferred with ADR.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"98618920+45ck@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T06:24:30Z","created_by":"45ck","updated_at":"2026-02-22T06:24:30Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-23T04:16:28.101Z"}

The current HTTP routing uses custom regex matching in a single large handler module, making route registration, middleware composition, and path parameter extraction fragile and hard to maintain. Scope: (1) Audit the current routing implementation — count routes, identify middleware application points, note any non-standard routing features. (2) Choose a migration target: Hono (lighter, more modern) or Fastify (richer ecosystem, more mature). Create an ADR for this choice. (3) Migrate routes incrementally — route by route, keeping old routing as fallback until all routes are migrated. (4) Migrate middleware — extract existing middleware (auth, logging, error handling, rate limiting) to framework-compatible middleware functions. (5) Update integration tests to use the new router. (6) Remove old regex routing module. Acceptance criteria: all routes served by framework router; all middleware correctly applied; existing API contract preserved (no breaking changes); bundle/startup time not significantly increased; ADR committed to docs/adr/.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"98618920+45ck@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T06:38:19Z","created_by":"45ck","updated_at":"2026-02-22T06:38:19Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bead-e1bh","depends_on_id":"bead-lh3q","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-22T17:40:40Z","created_by":"45ck","metadata":"{}"}],"updatedAt":"2026-02-22T20:57:46.476Z"}

The control plane bootstrap uses in-memory or empty stub stores by default, meaning a deployment that omits required store configuration ships a silently non-functional system. Every store registration that defaults to an in-memory stub must instead throw a clear startup error unless explicitly configured for dev/test mode via an environment variable. Scope: (1) Audit the composition root / bootstrap file; list every store with a default in-memory implementation. (2) Add a startupGuard() helper that checks required env vars and throws a structured ConfigurationError with a helpful message if any required store is not configured. (3) Add a DEV_STUB_STORES=true env var that must be explicitly set to allow stubs (default off in production). (4) Add a startup integration test that confirms the process exits non-zero if required stores are not configured. Acceptance criteria: app fails to start with clear error if required stores are missing config; DEV_STUB_STORES gate is documented in .env.local.example; startup test in CI.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"claude","owner":"98618920+45ck@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T06:38:10Z","created_by":"45ck","updated_at":"2026-02-22T07:30:06Z","closed_at":"2026-02-22T07:30:06Z","close_reason":"Added store-bootstrap-gate.ts with checkStoreBootstrapGate().
